## Abstract
Travel-Tracker is an application that manages and tracks trips for individual users as well as a travel agency.  A user is able to login as a traveler and will find a dashboard displaying all of their personal information including trips and the total amount they have spent on trips this year.  In addition, the user may book a trip to be reviewed by a travel agent.  While logged in as an agent, the user may look at all trips and approve or deny pending trips, as well as cancel upcoming trips.  The agent can also see all of the travelers' information.

### Learning Goals
 - Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
 - Work with an API to send and receive data
 - Solidify the code review process
 - Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
